          <p>The year is 1985, and I see on TV a segment about Burt Rutan, an aerospace engineer who had designed radical airplanes, including the VariEze, VariViggen, and Voyager. The image of the three airplanes flying in formation has been hard-coded in my brain. Then, as I worked through my aerospace engineering degree, I got some exposure to composites and begin dreaming about builind a Rutan design. I was dead centered on building a Long-EZ and began getting involved with Rutan Aircraft Flying Experience, where I was able to get up close to Canards for the very first time. A VariEze project became available, and I started taking a closer look at the aircraft. It has decent cruise and range for my mission, and it will be the perfect platform to learn to build composite aircraft. So here we are, about to embark on a great adventure building an airplane at home. Some folks have taken decades to build their airplanes... the plans do say it should take 340 man-hours for Part I (manufacturing of basic airframe). We shall see where I land.

<h4>So why a VariEze?</h4> 
      <ul>
<li>Simple to build and re-build</li>
<li>Plans-built, so no dependency on factory kits</li>
<li>Revolutionary design that disrupted the industry</li>
<li>Beautiful aircraft</li>
<li>Fits my mission: 1200-mile trip for two individuals for about 8 hours with a break in between </li>
      </ul>

<p>Ryz from RAFE posted on the COBA forum about a VariEze looking for a new home. I chatted with the project owner at the time, who told me some of the history of the project, and gave me a few pictures. <em></em>Canard, Wings, Bulkheads and Fuselage sides  are done</em>... and based on the pictures, it seemed to be the case. Project had been started by a builder group in New Hampshire before he acquired the project. After acquiring a Long-EZ, he decided not to pursue this project any longer. Condidering that I would not know about the condition of the project, but had the plans and RAFE nearby, I decided to acquire it. The complicated part was hauling it from Connecticut to Texas. Busy schedules and weather had prevented me from making the trip. However, the opportunity presented itself that I had the right amount of time to drive back and forth during a quiet time at work. The previous owner had given me the dimemsions of the project, and after measuring the internal volume of my vehicle, it seemed it woud all fit. Turns out, almost everything had to be carried on the roof rack. Wings and canard went on first. Then, the fuselage.... well, sort of. The previous owner had started building the fuselage, epoxying the sides and the bulkheads. I made the executive decision to break it all appart for easy loading. I fugured I was going to rebuild the bulkheads and most likely the fuselage sides. It will be good practice, and the foam on the fuselage sides might have seen better days. We loaded all the parts and covered them with a large tarp. I had brought a few straps, but not stron enough for 75 mph road trip. Thankfully a hardware store nearby provided the much needed long and wide straps that I used to properly tie the project. Thankfully, my hang gliding days have provided valuable experience here to attach delicate aircraft to a vehicle's roof. After 3 days of driving we finally arrived home. Now, time to open the<em> can of worms ;)</em>
